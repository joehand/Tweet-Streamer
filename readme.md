Going through the tutorial from:
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/learning-serverside-javascript-with-node-js/

Some updates were required with most recent version of Node.js:
*response.close() changed to response.end()
*response.sendHeader() changed to response.writeHead

Will be building on this a little to experiment.
